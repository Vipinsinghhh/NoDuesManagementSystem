## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd NoDuesManagementSystem
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install

cd ..\frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

Create `backend/.env`:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret
```

Create `frontend/.env`:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### 4. Run the app

In terminal 1 (backend):

## Main API Modules

- `/Student` - auth, profile, student list, faculty status updates, HOD decision updates
- `/Faculty` - auth, profile CRUD, teaching details CRUD, faculty listing/filtering
- `/Hod` - auth and profile management

## Current Workflow

1. Student registers/logs in and views dues status by subject.
2. Faculty logs in, reviews student submissions, and marks each item approved/rejected.
3. HOD reviews department students and gives final no-dues decision.

## Future Improvements

- Route-level JWT middleware enforcement on all protected APIs
- Better validation and error handling consistency
- Automated email/notification flow
- Test coverage for controllers and routes
- Better dashboard analytics and reports
